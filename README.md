# COURSE-PLANNER
## About the Project
Aim of this project is to create a course planner application. MSSQL is utilized to store required data which are user names, course names, academy names, 
deadlines for course completion, and course statuses (completed or incomplete). 
Users have the capability to register both completed and ongoing courses, which they have enrolled in to advance their skills. Additionally, users can delete or update a course as needed.
They also have the ability to list all courses in order to track their career paths. Below is a demonstration version with example course names.
