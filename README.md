# COURSE-PLANNER
## About the Project
Aim of this project is to create a course monitoring application. MSSQL is utilized to store required data which are user names, course names, academy names, 
deadlines of courses, completed times of courses, and course statuses (completed or incomplete). 
Users have the capability to register/add both completed and ongoing courses, which they have enrolled in to advance their skills. Users can delete a course or update a course to add completion time according to their learning process or career path.
They also have the ability to list all completed and incomplete courses. In addition to all the given features, users are able to track their monthly progress on a graph. Below is a demonstration version with example course names.
